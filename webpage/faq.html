        <p><b>When I first loaded it on my phone, I still had a couple of red X's on the display.
            Finally figured out that if you're not moving, it thinks (knows?) something isn't
            right? </b>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px"><u>Red X's</u>
            <br>The speed has to be non-zero (from memory I think the threshold is 1 m/s). There are
            also
            different behavior below and above the stall speed, which is why it is important to
            choose a
            suitable aircraft model in the "Manage" section. If yours is not there, let me know the
            V speeds and I will add it.

        <p style="margin-left: 40px"><u>Demo Mode</u>
            <br>In order to practice with the program, enable the "Demo Mode" and it will simulate
            movement
            allowing you to use it like a simple flight simulator.

            <p><b>What would you consider to be a 'comfortable' level of processing power and gyro/accelerometer
            quality for smooth, reliable operation? Component ID's are fine, but brand/model of phone or
            tablet would be even better for the lazy (me) among us.</b>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px"><u>Hardware/Devices</u>
            Like the saying goes, your 'milage will vary'. I have only tested on devices I personally own.

        <p><b>Would a 1st gen Nexus7 be adequate? 2013 version?
            What about some of the phones that are a few years old, like the Galaxy S4 or
            similar? </b>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px"><u>Hardware/Devices</u>
            <br>I have used the original Nexus7 (2012) for all the development and testing.
            It is adequate, but is the minimum I would use.
        <p style="margin-left: 40px">I tested with a Samsung S2 phone and that was close,
            but not quite good enough to be useful. I have been told that the later models of
            Samsung S 4/5 works well, but I have not had the opportunity to test for myself.
